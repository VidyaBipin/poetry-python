# Pull Request Check List

This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes. Please make sure that you tick all *appropriate* boxes.  But please read our [contribution guide](https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/contributing/) at least once, it will save you unnecessary review cycles!

- [ ] Added **tests** for changed code.
- [ ] Updated **documentation** for changed code.
- [ ] Based off the `develop` branch if introduces a new feature or changes current behavior, OR
- [ ] Based off the `master` branch if only a bug fix or documentation update

If you have *any* questions to *any* of the points above, just **submit and ask**!  This checklist is here to *help* you, not to deter you from contributing!
